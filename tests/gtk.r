    Title: "Small GTK3 Smoke Test"
    Author: "Shixin Zeng"

    Description: --{
        This is a minimal GTK3 test, just enough to bring up a window and
        show it counting when you click a button.

        Shixin demonstrated a fuller GTK3 application based on an automated
        import of GTK's interfaces at the 2019 conference:

          https://youtu.be/fMeTqPyrNF4?t=1259
    }--

    Notes: --{
      * GTK4 was released in late 2020, but GTK3 is still in wide use by major
        projects in 2025 with no pressing plans to migrate, e.g. Chrome,
        Firefox, Inkscape, GIMP, and Handbrake.

      * GTK3 integer/boolean types are 32-bit by design, to keep API/ABI
        stability across platforms and ensure consistent behavior between
        32-bit and 64-bit systems.

=== GTK INIT HELPER ===

; The GTK3 initialization function takes an optional ARGC and an ARGV, for the
; purpose of slipstreaming GTK settings from your command line into GTK's
; behavior.
;
; It scans for GTK-specific arguments (like --gtk-debug, --display, --sync),
; and removes them from the argument list. That way, your program can still
; process its own command-line arguments after GTK has had a chance to look at
; and remove the ones it cares about.
;
; GTK modifies argc and argv in-place. For example, if argv originally had 5
; arguments, and GTK consumed 2 of them, the remaining list will contain 3
; arguments (and argc will be updated accordingly).  It does not free any
; memory and will only reduce the count of argc and remove pointers from
; the argv array.
;
; GTK4 operates completely differently.  There is no gtk_init() function.
;
; So we could ignore this and pass nulls, the original script passed pointers
; to argv and argc, so that's kept to show at least one way of doing this.
; It also allows us to pass "--gtk-debug".

    ; gets synthesized from the values.  But then (argv.args).1: winds up
    ; doing an assignment into that transient block, which does not affect
    ; the original data.  This concept of "subcell addressing" is likely best
    ; addressed by making the VECTOR! type able to map directly onto the
