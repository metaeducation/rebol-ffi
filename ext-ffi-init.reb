    Notes: --{
        The FFI was not initially implemented with any usermode code.  But
        just as with the routines in the SYS context, there's opportunity for
        replacing some of the non-performance-critical C that does parsing and
        processing into Rebol.  This is especially true since FFI was changed
        to use fewer specialized structures to represent ROUTINE! and
        STRUCT!, instead using arrays...to permit it to be factored into an
        extension.

    void [<opt>]

    int8 [integer!]
    uint16 [integer!]
    int16 [integer!]
    uint32 [integer!]
    int32 [integer!]
    uint64 [integer!]

    float [decimal!]
    double [decimal!]

    ; Note: ACTION! is only legal to pass to pointer arguments if it is was
    ; created with MAKE-ROUTINE or WRAP-CALLBACK

; The idea of MAKE-CALLBACK is to allow you to write something like:
;
;     callback: make-callback [
;         return: [int64]
;         a [pointer]
;         b [pointer]
;     ][
;         ; body of function, Rebol code
;     ]
;
; And it will produce an ACTION! with legal Rebol types, e.g.
;
;     temp: function [
;         return: [integer!]
;         a [integer!]
;         b [integer!]
;     ][
;         ; body of function, Rebol code
;     ]
;
; Then it will wrap that callback up with the FFI interface:
;
;     wrap-callback temp/ [return: [int64] a [pointer] b [pointer]]
;
; So it just saves you the extra step.
;
; (At time of writing it does not map the types, it just creates the function
; with no types, e.g. (function [a b] [...]), but that's easy enough.)

    ; Because if an improper type is given as the reaction to an error, that
    ; just creates *another* error...so you'll still get a panic() anyway.

    ; does not crash.

    ; Wrapping process is a bit more complex in modern binding, because the
    ; block we get is already bound, and we need some mechanism to invasively
    ; "overbind" it or it will not see the function's arguments:
