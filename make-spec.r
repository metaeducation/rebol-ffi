    ; Note: FFI once statically linked to `Trap_Find_Function_In_Library()`
    ; in the LIBRARY! extension.  Now it uses librebol calls to execute
    ; "make library! ..." etc., and gets POINTER! back.  So it does not
    ; need to do that any longer

    ; Note: Vectors are used to model C array structures, and so you have
    ; to have the vector extension available if you're going to do any FFI
    ; with arrays.  But similar to the library extension, VECTOR! is now
    ; accessed through API calls with HANDLE!.
